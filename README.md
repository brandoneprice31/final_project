2.Choose a game option: Human vs. Human, Human vs. Comp, or Comp vs. Comp.

3.Click a square to make a move.  Three in a row wins the game.

4.After the game is over, click the screen to play again.



# Checkers Instructions:

1. Run Checkers by typing in the command “python checkers_graphics.py” in the terminal.

2. Choose a game option: Human vs. Human, Human vs. Comp, or Comp vs. Comp.

3. If you are playing the computer, the program randomly selects who goes first so you might have to wait a second for the computer to make a move, otherwise click a piece that you want to move and the program will highlight all possible moves for that piece. You may need to try both white and red pieces to see which one you’ve been assigned.

4. Click one of the highlighted moves to move that piece.  If a piece gets to the back row it will become a king and be able to move both ways.  Jump over all the opponents pieces or trap the opponent so that he or she have no moves left to win the game.

5. Note that double jumps are not allowed in this version of the game.

6. After the game is over, click the screen to play again.
